      <p>Welcome to my webpage! My name is Tom Pocius. I am a full stack developer student with Northwestern University Coding Bootcamp looking to jump careers out of the medical field and into programming. 
      </p>
      <p>I recieved my bachelors degree from Elmhurst College with an Exercise Science degree and my doctorate in Physical Therapy at Governors State University. I have been working full time as an acute physiacl therapist at U Chicago Medicine at Ingalls Memorial Hospital since 2014 as an acute specialist. I specialize in communicating with medical professionals and facilitating mobility for critically sick patients, as well as, working with hospital administration for patient throughput during patient length of stay.
      </p>
      <p>Outside of work I enjoy playing hockey, sailing and being with my dog Evey. Checkout my other webpage from my portfolio tab to look at pictures of Evey.
